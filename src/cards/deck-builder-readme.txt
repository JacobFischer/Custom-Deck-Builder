Congratulations on building your custom deck! This file helps to explain what you can do with your cool new cards.

The intended use for these images is to import into a card program, like Tabletop Simulator.

## Tabletop Simulator

Tabletop Simulator can build custom decks of cards from textures (images) that contains a grid of cards. If you already know how to import custom decks into Tabletop Simulator, great! Otherwise this readme can help you.

For reference, your Deck was generated with {width} cards horizontally and {height} cards vertically, though the last sheets of normal and oversized cards may have less.

## Other Notes

This file and the textures were generated using the Cryptozoic Deck Building Game Custom Card Builder tool created by Jacob Fischer.
